# Project Title:
Detection of Obesity Levels in Individuals

# Description:
The purpose of this project is to create a balanced machine learning model that can predict the level of obesity a person is in. It is very important for the model to be as balanced as possible, as this is not a binary classification. We are dealing with a total of seven classifications, making it relatively easy for the model to have some type of preference or bias when predicting. We will also aim to evaluate and determine the factors that contribute to the development of obesity, all through exhaustive data analysis.

# Data Acquisition:
The data was obtained for free from the Kaggle website, which offers a variety of datasets for different projects.

# Final Model Performance for the Specific Project:
We will find that the model is quite balanced, with no bias or preference in prediction despite a slight imbalance in the data. I decided not to balance the data to demonstrate that even with this small issue, the model can be entirely balanced, much more so than some other projects published on the same Kaggle portal. The main focus is to know how to use the data to build the best and most balanced model.

# Clarification of the Final Conclusion:
The data we work with is intended for educational purposes and is 77% synthetic according to the Kaggle website. This means some final conclusions might lack relevance in a real-world setting. However, my intention is to demonstrate my skills in machine learning and exploratory data analysis, whether the data is synthetic or not. The decisions and final conclusions are based on this context and do not replace scientific studies with 100% real data from a population.
